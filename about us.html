 Atlantic Publications was set up by in 1997. It was initially just a humble, little shop with a few shelves of books.<BR>
Slowly and gradually,we expanded into the fine establishment that helps you get your books.<BR>
Our house has changed with time and has grown into a beautiful lifestyle store<BR>
to make our customers' lives beautiful and full of whimsy.<BR>
We keep candels and music to give the store the zen and the ambiance it and our customers deserve.<BR>
Today, we have an online portal for our customers to order books over the internet!<BR>
We hope you enjoy ATLANTIC PUBLICATIONS...</FONT><BR>
